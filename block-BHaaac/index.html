"...I want to know<br>
if you can be with joy<br>
mine or your own<br>
if you can dance with wildness<br>
and let the ecstasy fill you<br>
to the tips of your fingers and toes<br>
without cautioning us<br>
to be careful<br>
to be realistic<br>
to remember the limitations<br>
of being human.<br>
<br>
It doesn't interest me<br>
if the story you are telling me<br>
is true.<br>
I want to know if you can<br>
disappoint another<br>
to be true to yourself.<br>
If you can bear<br>
the accusation of betrayal<br>
and not betray your own soul.<br>
If you can be faithless<br>
and therefore trustworthy..."<br>
